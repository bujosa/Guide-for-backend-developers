# Guide-for-backend-developers
This is a guide for backend developers with those languages: Typescript and Javascript

## Programming Courses for Backend development
Backend Development is also known as server-side development. It is everything that the users donâ€™t see and contains behind-the-scenes activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It focuses primarily on databases, backend logic, APIs, and Servers.


About NodeJS, mongoose with express. 
NodeJS This is a project-based course where we build an extensive, in-depth backend API for DevCamper, a bootcamp directory app. We will start from scratch and end up with a professional deployed API with documentation. We will dive deep into Node, Express and MongoDB.

Understanding typescript  This Course takes you from the very Basics and its most important Feature (Types!) to the Point where you're able to use TypeScript in any of your Projects. ReactJS Projects included!

About NestJS and typescript
NestJS beginning NestJS leverages the incredible popularity and robustness of JavaScript as a language and Node.js as a technology. It is inspired by common libraries and frameworks such as Angular, React and Vue which improve developer productivity and experience.

About design patterns in typescript
Design patterns This course starts by exploring SOLID principles to write clean code. Then you will create new objects and instance of classes with creational design Patterns. Next, you will utilize dependency injection with InversifyJS to create testable, maintainable, and extensible code.

**Optional** This course is a guide to understanding MongoDB and its full scope.
MongoDB guide MongoDB is one of the most important NoSQL databases you can work with these days. It's extremely popular and MongoDB developers are in high demand.

**Optional** From this official mongo page, we have done several courses that we consider are very good to learn more about the concept and how it works.

This course below is a bit more forward-thinking, but it gives you an idea and ways to solve problems based on microservices.

Microservices with NodeJS and react Microservices are the number one solution for building and scaling out apps that are intended to grow.  Just one little issue: there are few resources online that delve into the most complex and nasty issues around them!  I built this course to fix that.  This course tackles every major issue around microservices head on. From challenges with data replication to confusing unordered event streams, every major challenge of building microservices is covered.

**Optional** Complete guide to building a GraphQL API GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook to power their mobile applications. It's a replacement for traditional REST API's and is far more flexible and faster. With GraphQL you can query multiple resources with a single request to the server. Making it ideal for web applications and mobile apps.

## Books for programming 
Clean Architecture For more experienced software engineers, most of the content will not be new, but it will probably spark some ideas for current and upcoming software projects, as it has for me.
Clean Code This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code
Data Structures and Algorithms Algorithms and data structures are much more than abstract concepts. Mastering them enables you to write code that runs faster and more efficiently, which is particularly important for today web and mobile apps.

**Optional** Building Secure & Reliable System In this book, experts from Google share best practices to help your organization design scalable and reliable systems that are fundamentally secure.

## IDE
Visual studio code This course is to understand how Visual Studio code works, I consider this idea as one of the most used and that every programmer should know. Download here
